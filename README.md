- domains/jason.json (template for is-a.dev registration)

## Quick steps to register with is-a.dev

1. Fork https://github.com/is-a-dev/register
2. In your fork, create `domains/<subdomain>.json` (example file included as `domains/jason.json`)
   - Replace `yourusername` and `my-personal-website` with your actual GitHub username and repo.
3. Commit the JSON and open a Pull Request to is-a-dev/register.
4. Set up GitHub Pages (if you want to host on GitHub Pages) OR deploy to Vercel and update the `CNAME` value.
5. Once your PR is merged, the DNS will be created and `yourname.is-a.dev` will point to the target you set.

If you want, I can generate a ready-to-copy PR JSON with your real GitHub username and the exact CNAME once you tell me your GitHub username or preferred subdomain.
